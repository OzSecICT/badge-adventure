# OzSec 2024: Adventure Badge

This guide walks you through collecting all of the CTF flags within the game.

## Connecting to the Game

## The Training Area

The training area is intended to get you familiar with the commands and options avialable to you within the game. 

You start off in the Training Tent where you can talk to a Non-Player Character (NPC) and read a paper with some instructions. When you're ready to leave, you can use your navigation commands to exit to the west.

In the Great Outdoors you will find an item on the ground that you can pick up, and a button that will transport you to the main game. 

You will need to speak to the NPC here and let him know you are ready to leave in order for the button to work. 

Before you leave, speak to Bob and if you follow the right dialog tree he will give you your first flag. You can head north and enter the vault to pick up your second flag. 

After heading north, `unlock` the vault door with the key you picked up outside. Enter and you can pick up the second flag. 

Now that you have the flags, head back outside and let Bob know you are ready to leave, then hit the button to be transported.

## Kansas City

Welcome to Kansas City! You wake up on a bus in the maintenance garage and need to get a ticket out of here. You can get a ticket after helping get their buses back online. 

You will need to repair each bus in the garage before returning to the manager to get a ticket. 

Before you leave, make sure you pick up the slice of cheese for a flag from the break room. 

## Topeka

Topeka's local hospital is having a cyber incident, you need to help them collect some drives from PC's to perform incident response analysis on. 

Find the hospital off of I-70. Pull the drives from the five PC's scattered around the hospital complex, and don't forget to grab a box of donuts from the break room!

While you're exploring, you will find a Raspnberry Pi in a networking closet, if you take that to the manager of the incident response firm you can place it with his collection of Pi's for a flag. 

Bring the box of donuts and the five drives to the conference room in the hospital to get two flags and complete this area.

Head you can head west to Ellsworth, or South to Chanute. 

You can travel to Wichita if you want to go to another city, but Wichita itself is currently off limits until you complete all other towns. 

## Chanute

Chanute has a reporter writing a story on the city. He heard that there was a brief time that Chanute had a differnet name, help him find the alternative name for the city. 

This area has only the one flag, but there are a few other actions you can perform like picking up some coffee. 

To complete this area, head to the Town Hall, and go out their back exit into the alleyway. There you will find a sign with the name that the city used to have. Bring this to the reporter in the town hall to complete.

From here you can head down to Pittsburg by heading to the southeast corner of the map.

## Pittsburg

The city network is experiencing some issues, and the Town Hall needs to get some information to the court house. Stop by Town Hall and pick up a letter, deliver it to the Court House for a flag. 

While you're heading into town, stop by the local flower shop and coffee shop to pick up a flower and coffee that needs to be delivered. 

The coffee was ordered by someone waiting in the court house, go deliver that for a flag. While you're there, deliver the letter from the Town Hall for another flag. 

Make note of the network closet in the back of the court house, you can pick up a flash drive from the local park and try plugging it in! Probably not a great idea, but hey it gets you a flag!

To complete this area you will need to visit the local university and help them get their computer lab back online. 

Grab a ladder from one of the classrooms and hop over the wall through the ceiling tiles to get into the computer lab.

Once you're in the computer lab, shutdown and unplug the random computer there. 

To finish this up, go back to the town hall and ask the receptionist to try it again, as their network should be back online now for the final flag.
