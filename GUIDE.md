## The Training Area

The training area is intended to get you familiar with the commands and options avialable to you within the game. 

You start off in the Training Tent where you can talk to a Non-Player Character (NPC) and read a paper with some instructions. When you're ready to leave, you can use your navigation commands to exit to the west.

In the Great Outdoors you will find an item on the ground that you can pick up, and a button that will transport you to the main game. 

You will need to speak to the NPC here and let him know you are ready to leave in order for the button to work. 

Before you leave, speak to Bob and if you follow the right dialog tree he will give you your first flag. You can head north and enter the vault to pick up your second flag. 

After heading north, `unlock` the vault door with the key you picked up outside. Enter and you can pick up the second flag. 

Now that you have the flags, head back outside and let Bob know you are ready to leave, then hit the button to be transported.

## Kansas City

Welcome to Kansas City! You wake up on a bus in the maintenance garage and need to get a ticket out of here. You can get a ticket after helping get their buses back online. 

You will need to repair each bus in the garage before returning to the manager to get a ticket. 

Before you leave, make sure you pick up the slice of cheese for a flag from the break room. 

## Topeka

Topeka's local hospital is having a cyber incident, you need to help them collect some drives from PC's to perform incident response analysis on. 

Find the hospital off of I-70. Pull the drives from the five PC's scattered around the hospital complex, and don't forget to grab a box of donuts from the break room!

While you're exploring, you will find a Raspnberry Pi in a networking closet, if you take that to the manager of the incident response firm you can place it with his collection of Pi's for a flag. 

Bring the box of donuts and the five drives to the conference room in the hospital to get two flags and complete this area.

Head you can head west to Ellsworth, or South to Chanute. 

You can travel to Wichita if you want to go to another city, but Wichita itself is currently off limits until you complete all other towns. 

## Chanute

Chanute has a reporter writing a story on the city. He heard that there was a brief time that Chanute had a differnet name, help him find the alternative name for the city. 

This area has only the one flag, but there are a few other actions you can perform like picking up some coffee. 

To complete this area, head to the Town Hall, and go out their back exit into the alleyway. There you will find a sign with the name that the city used to have. Bring this to the reporter in the town hall to complete.

From here you can head down to Pittsburg by heading to the southeast corner of the map.

## Pittsburg

The city network is experiencing some issues, and the Town Hall needs to get some information to the court house. Stop by Town Hall and pick up a letter, deliver it to the Court House for a flag. 

While you're heading into town, stop by the local flower shop and coffee shop to pick up a flower and coffee that needs to be delivered. 

The coffee was ordered by someone waiting in the court house, go deliver that for a flag. While you're there, deliver the letter from the Town Hall for another flag. 

Make note of the network closet in the back of the court house, you can pick up a flash drive from the local park and try plugging it in! Probably not a great idea, but hey it gets you a flag!

To complete this area you will need to visit the local university and help them get their computer lab back online. 

Grab a ladder from one of the classrooms and hop over the wall through the ceiling tiles to get into the computer lab.

Once you're in the computer lab, shutdown and unplug the random computer there. 

To finish this up, go back to the town hall and ask the receptionist to try it again, as their network should be back online now for the final flag. 

## Ellsworth

The water supply in Ellsworth is having some issues with quality. Stop by the water plant on the east side of town and see if you can help them fix their issues. 

You will need to get permission to access the water plant, so before you head there stop by the water company offices on the main street of town and grab an access card. 

While you're out exploring the city, find and stop by the post office to pick up a package and a flag. 

After you have the keycard, visit the water plant and check in with security. They will let you in where you can test the quality of the water and restore the chemical levels to normal levels. 

But first you need to find out why your changes keep getting reverted. If you check the network closet there is an unknown PC there. Unplug it and you can now restore water levels, check the quality, and report your findings to the operator. This will complete the town and light your badge, and give you a flag.

Before you head out of down, grab a soda from one of the shops and give it to the groundskeeper in the park for a flag.

## Goodland

Goodland has been overrun by robot taxis! Sadly, they have begun breaking down and causing all sorts of issues for the locals. 

You can help fix them by visiting a local auto shop and picking up a key to the taxi, then going to the telecom provider in town and picking up a usb key to re-flash the taxi firmware. 

There are five taxi's stuck around the city, the first one you should have seen when you first netered town. Another one is further to the west from the auto shop, and the rewst are up north near the airport and faire. 

While you're helping the taxi's, pick up a plane ticket for a flag at the airport, and visit the fair for a turkey leg with another flag on it. 

From here you can head down to Dodge City, or to Ellsworth. 

## Dodge City

As you enter Dodge City, there's a Flipper Zero laying on the ground, make sure and pick that up as it's needed. You'll be freeing 'The Associate' and you need to clone some keycards to do that. 

After you are armed with a Fllipper, visit the local saloon and clone the sherrif's keycard while he's busy. While you're in there stop by the bar and pick up a drink, or head over to the local gas station and pick up an energy drink.

On your way to the sherrif's office enter the game room of the saloon and offer the player a drink for a flag. When you get to the sherrifs office head into the jail and replay the sherrifs keycard to free the associate. 

Next head down to the train station and clone the keycard of the train operator on your way, this will allow you to unlock the train car for another flag. 

As you exit town via the train, your final flag will be revealed and this city will light up o your badge.



## Newton

The college in Newton has suffered a cyber incident that took their systems down. Thankfully they have proper disaster recovery documentation and recovery instrucitons. 

Unfortunately, they seem to have misplaced the documents. Can you help collect the 4 pages of the DR document and help their IT guy get systems back online? 

Search through the college campus to find the recovery documents. You will find a USB drive in the parking lot on your way there, pick it up for a flag when you insert it into their server. Maybe don't do that in real life.. but this is just a game, right?

While you're searching for the recovery documents, grab some lunch for the poor IT guy, he's working really hard. 

Return lunch and the recovery documents to the IT guy in the campus and be rewarded with the flag and this city is completed. 

Next, head over to Wichita to complete the final quests!

## Wichita

Wichita has two main quests, the water company and the airport. If you visit the water company in the northern side of town you be tasked with visiting a local bank branch to pick up a backup tape so they can restore from backups.

Return to the IT manager and let him you know you have the tape and he will give you a key to the datacenter. Go across the hall to the datacenter and load the tapes. Return to the manager to let him know for your first flag. 

The aiport has suffered from a vendor's incident that has taken their computers offline. You will need to visit the IT guy in the food court, and pick up a flash drive that will auto-reboot and fix the PC's. 

Once you have the drive, go around the airport rebooting each of the five PC's. You will need to pick up some keys from the janitors closet on the east side of the airport, and unlock the closet on the west side to get the final PC. Don't forget to check the TSA line for one of the PC's that needs rebooted. 

After completing both the water company and airport quests you will complete the main quests of Wichita, and the RGB LED on your badge should turn green, congratulations!

You can pick up a phamplhet from the bank's loan office and give it to a farmer inthe farmers market for a flag.
